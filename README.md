MongoDB uses collections to organise data. These are comparative with tables in relational databases.
Inside collections are documents, and these form the equivalent to fields and rows of a table and store all of the information.

These are the basic steps we carried out to display example data on a local server:

- Connect to database
- Define schema
- Create collection/model
- Create dummy data
- Save to database
- Create simple server
- Read dummy data from database
- Display dummy data

If you are running the database locally make sure to have it running to be able to extract data from it!
